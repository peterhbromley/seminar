Spring 2018 CS701B Project

NOTE: This repository is currently a work in progress.  All models in the "code" folder are working, but not yet setup to be run by anybody from the command line (i.e. data paths are hard-coded to my directories).  Feel free to use the models as a reference, and check back soon for the finalized repository!
